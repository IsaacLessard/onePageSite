		<h2>Who Am I</h2>
			<p>Born in Fort Collins, Colorado, I have moved every <i>3 years</i> of my life, usually between countries or continents. This is quite tiring... I hope to setlle down and work for an awesome company.</p>
			<p>I gradauted high school in Fruita, Colorado, and have been slowly finishing a double major,<b> Business Administration, Information Systems Management,</b> online while travelling and working. I have <b><i>finished</i></b> a certificate program in <b>Project Management</b>.</p>
			<p>Recently moved back to Colorado from Tokyo, where I was an English teacher, math tutor, PE teacher, a guitarist in a Japanese rock band, and a bilingual accountant for international schools and non-profits. I'm staying at my relative's house in <b>Castle Rock</b> while I finish this school.</p>
			<p>While in Tokyo, I was handed a website to manage as I was the only one with <b><i>IT experience... </i> </b> this lead me to discover I am passionate about coding. I plan to turn this passion into a career, and to help non-profits in a more professional manner.</p><a href="#home">^TOP</a>

	<div class="jumbo future" id="future">
		<h2>Direction</h2>
		<p>I hope to become a senior developer. It would be equally stellar to be working at an international company, and have enough time/work freedom to spearhead personal projects. I hope to be creating context professionally, and also being creative in my free time.</p>
			<p>While working full time, I plan to finish my two undergratuate degrees online. I would also enjoy getting a masters in Information Systems Management.</p>
			<p>Web-based technologies are amazing. I would love to work for a company that provides in-browser applications such as Duolingo.</p><a href="#home">^TOP</a>
